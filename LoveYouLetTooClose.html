    <h1>Sinking Me</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
  <p>  As I'm burning alive inside my mind
        Trying to feel, trying to breathe
        I swear I tried<br>
    But now I'm broken looking for something
        Looking for something that isn't here
        Everything I could really do without has never been so, been so clear
        Broken, looking for something, looking for something that isn't me
        Everything I could really do without is sinking, sinking me<br>
   Knowing that I'm really coming to terms with the reality of a broken spine
        Cost of the weight of the world, unsure if I could hold it all up, buy some time
        Clean myself of the dust on the floor
        Hollow me out, watch me endure
        I've been down here far too long, too many shades of gray
        The sight is sore
        I used to be so worth saving<br>
     But now I'm broken looking for something
    Looking for something that isn't here
    Everything I could really do without has never been so, been so clear
    Broken, looking for something, looking for something that isn't me
    Everything I could really do without is sinking, sinking me<br>
  I'm burning alive inside my mind
        Trying to feel, trying to breathe
        I swear I tried, I swear I tried<br>
        I swear I tried
    Show me that I can feel again
    I'm sick of this loss being all I claim
    Numb to the touch, burning alive
    Void of a color, void of a name
    Show me that I can feel again
    I'm sick of this loss being all I claim
    Numb to the touch, burning alive
    Void of a color, void of a name
    I used to be so worth saving<br>
  Broken, looking for something
    Looking for something that isn't here
    Everything I could really do without...<br>
    But now I'm broken looking for something
    Looking for something that isn't here
   Everything I could really do without has never been so, been so clear
        Broken, looking for something, looking for something that isn't me
        Everything I could really do without is sinking, sinking me

    <h1>Tradition</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>So maybe I was wrong, I couldn't leave it dead
        I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
        We'll never be the same, I see it missing
        I hate the way that you are but we're not that different<br>
        Face in the mirror I'm okay now, I'm okay now
        Least that's what I'll keep telling myself on the way down, on the way down
        Maybe I'm to blame, can't help what I'm thinking
        Least that's what I'll keep telling myself but I'll keep singing<br>
        Cut down like it's all tradition
        Heart rate, can you see it missing
        Step back, I won't admit that maybe I'm broken, I won't listen
        Cut down like it's all tradition
        Heart rate can you see it missing
        Leave it, I don't want to be that, I don't want to be the one left bleeding
        But now I'm stuck tailored to this suit of broken skin<br>
        So maybe I was wrong I couldn't leave it dead
        I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
        We'll never be the same, I see it missing
        I hate the way that you are but we're not that different<br>
        Am I worth fixing, is all I really have to say
        Take in my perspective or I can find myself a way
        Breaking down the structure of my soul until I can see
        Everything so resilient, showing proof that I can breathe
        Just know that I'll keep singing, I'll keep breathing
        My reflection is all I'm missing<br>
        I'll keep singing, I'll keep breathing
        My reflection is all I'm missing<br>
        So maybe I was wrong I couldn't leave it dead
        I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
        We'll never be the same, I see it missing
        I hate the way that you are but we're not that different</p>

<h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<p>And now I lost the feeling
    Why do I feel like home was never here.
    And now I lost the feeling.
    Why do I feel like home was never here?<br>
    Do you see the paint chipping off the walls?
    Marks of anger marks of love.
    Will I remember this at all?<br>
    Why does it happen every time I Leave
    Weighing the cost of the life I lead.
    I want to be everywhere I'm not
    Paying the price of the world I see.<br>
    And now I lost the feeling
    Why do I feel like home was never here.
    And now I lost the feeling
    Why do I feel like home was never here.<br>
    Do you see the paint chipping off the walls?
    Marks of anger marks of love.
    Will I remember this .?
    Do you see the paint chipping off the walls?
    I can barely even recognize me
    Was it you or was i the one who changed?<br>
    And now I lost the feeling
    Why do I feel like home was never here.
    And now I lost the feeling
    Why do I feel like home was never here.
    Home was never here

        I've been caught up shaking alone
        I hate these sleepless nights
        Spending too much time in the shade but I'm hoping I'll be alright
        I'm sick of the feeling, sick of the haunting
        I'm sick of the lonely, empty bed
        I'm sick of the moments, you leave and you know it

    <p>I'm living in a grey scale, what am I seeing
        Learn to love the pressure, that caving feeling
        Cause I know it all too well, tell me please
        Tell me, do you trust in everything, everything you see <br>
        I'd rather die than see you carry my weight one second.
        How to walk the line between the levels of hell and heaven
        Don't hold me up because I'm bound to let you down
        Just get away, make the distance
        (Make the distance)<br>
        Are you following along, do you get me?
        Stay away, though don't forget me
        Wondering if they even notice
        Me washing away like the ocean
        Left on the shoreline
        Can't do this alone
        But really I don't think I'm worth the time
        Tell me that you promise you'll just get away.
        I won't drag you down all at the cost of me<br>
        I'd rather die than see you carry my weight one second.

    <h1>The Love You Let Too Close</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>This isn't just another sunset, finality hangs low in the air.
        The last page of a story all too
        Short, you can see there was a battle here.
        Substance and a pain eternal, infidelity so infernal.
        A friend, lover, song and a brother, taken too early by his own hand.<br>
        The poison lays on the table,
        Note with a final goodbye within arms reach.
        If only we could see it in your eyers, so unstable.
        If only you could've shared the pain with me.
        If only.<br>
        You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
        You couldn't bury the pain, instead it buried you.
        You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
        You couldn't bury it all.<br>
        Now I just go through the motions.
        Watching it all just fade away.
        Now I just go through the motions.
        Taking it all day by day.<br>
        Now I just go through the motions.
        Wishing that I could've noticed.
        Now I just go through the motions.<br>
        March 26th, the day you left us.
        Broken by the love you let too close, I couldn't see.
        The pain in your heart now it lives in your mothers eyes.
        And now you're gone and it's killing me.<br>
        You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
        You couldn't bury the pain, instead it buried you.
        You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
        You couldn't bury it all.<br>
        Now I just go through the motions.
        Watching it all just fade away.
        Now I just go through the motions.
        Taking it all day by day.

    Do you see me drifting away
    Gone like the waves and the wind you breathe?
    I can feel it surround me
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the... <br>
    Here I am looking for you
    I know the voice I don't recognize the tone
    And would you say I adore you?
    Now I'm chasing the sun and I'm on my own
    Watching the light pass, say what you couldn't say to me
    I'm sitting idly just waiting, just waiting<br>
    Drifting away, gone like the waves and the wind you breathe
    I can feel it surround me
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the sea
    Maybe I'm letting go, the feeling is caving in
    Maybe I'll let it out, and maybe I'll keep it in
    How did I get this way?
    I'm sinking slowly
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the sea<br>
    It's got me feeling like I'll never be getting home
    Tell me you're better off, leaving is simple
    When will you think of me, how long until
    You hide me away in the back of your mind
    If I'm so forgettable, then kill me I'd rather die<br>
    Drifting away, gone like the waves and the wind you breathe
    I can feel it surround me
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the sea
    Maybe I'm letting go, the feeling is caving in
    Maybe I'll let it out, and maybe I'll keep it in
    How did I get this way?
    I'm sinking slowly
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the sea<br>
    Why do I feel like I'm chipping away, and I'm tied to the anchor?
    If this is the end then I'll sing my song
    I'm chipping away, going down with the anchor
    You already know what to say
    Maybe I'm letting go, the feeling is caving in
    Maybe I'll let it out, and maybe I'll keep it in
    How did I get this way, I'm sinking slowly
    It's got me feeling alone like a wolf in the sea </p>

    I lost my friend, myself, and my brother to the poison<br>
    I don't know how to say this to you, when I can't even help myself
    I battled my own use, know it's the cold truth
        I don't want us to end up on the shelf</p>

    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<p>To be honest, I didn't think my heart could weigh so heavy on my chest
    Is it really safe that I carry my loss so closely
    Now it's starting to hurt you and the way that you know me
    I learned so fast
    I've never known anyone like you
    Really there's no place like you<br>
    But now you're leaving
    Now you hate me, and I don't blame you
    Cause I'm carrying the weight of two souls on my back and I'm wearing thin
    How am I used to this
    How did you even love me anyways<br>
    And I know that going my way isn't easy
    But now I'm wondering how you see me
    Cause I've never let anyone this close before
    Really there's no place like you
    But now you're leaving
    Now you hate me, and I don't blame you
    Cause I'm carrying the weight of two souls on my back and I'm wearing thin
    How am I used to this
    How did you even love me anyways<br>
    And now I'm wearing thin
    How am I used to this<br>
    Now I'm living in isolation
    There's a part of me I buried with him
    That I'd do anything for you to see
    I don't know how we ended up like this so far away
    But there's just no place, there's just no place like you

    <h1>Into The Gray</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<p>

    I can recall the day that I felt like I lost everything in the world
    And I can recall the way
    The way she told me his body was lifeless, and everything went numb<br>
    I still remember the sound of the silence
    All the worlds are gone like the wind
    And now all love is gone with the ocean
    Now I can barely breathe
    Show me the sound of love<br>
    This is where it left me, I didn't know I could feel like this
    This is where it left me, into the black, into the gray
    This is who I am now, picking up the pieces slowly
    This is who I am now, sever the ties you wouldn't even know me
    This is where it left me, I didn't know I could feel like this
    This is where it left me, into the black, into the gray
