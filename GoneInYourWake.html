    <h1>Chemical</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p> I let you tell me how it goes and when it's all gonna end
        I put you first in the world but you hate me again
        I'm stuck with the thoughts that remind me of
        All the things that you couldn't just seem to love

        I almost had you in my hands
        Some things never go as planned
        Took as much as I could stand
        Some things never change

        Show me what I gotta do to let go
        All I really know is that it's chemical
        Turn the lights off, let the door close
        If it's meant to be then it's chemical
        Chemical, chemical, chemical
        All I really know is that it's chemical

        I let you tear me all apart and watched you put it all back
        And like a dose too heavy all my blood's going black
        But you push and you pull 'til it's deadly
        I bet you'd love to know that I'm shaking

        Closer than it's ever been
        Farther than it's ever felt
        You won't ever understand
        Some things never change

        Show me what I gotta do to let go
        All I really know is that it's chemical
        Turn the lights off, let the door close
        If it's meant to be then it's chemical
        Chemical, chemical, chemical
        All I really know is that it's chemical

        It's killing me to know that I almost had you
        It's killing me to know you're still in my veins

        It's killing me to know that I almost let go
        To see the wind pushing you

        Show me what I gotta do to let go
        All I really know is that it's chemical
        Turn the lights off, let the door close
        If it's meant to be then it's (chemical)

        Show me what I gotta do to let go
        All I really know is that it's chemical
        Turn the lights off, let the door close
        If it's meant to be then it's chemical
        Chemical, chemical, chemical
        All I really know is that it's chemical

    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>Watch me go and, watch me go and
        Sever everything here that I feel close to
        I don't know why
        I don't know why I feel the disassociation
        From you I'm forsaken, crowded room I hate this
        I don't feel surrounded, poison dead without it

        Now I've gotta take a breath
        Tell myself there's love to give
        Now I've gotta take a breath
        Lack of shadow's caving in
        It's caving in, caving in
        My lack of shadow is caving in

        It's been about a season since I haven't needed you
        It's been about a decade since I felt complete
        Can you tell that I'm suffocating
        The pain inside me, it's activating
        Activating

        Now I've gotta take a breath
        Tell myself there's love to give
        Now I've gotta take a breath
        Lack of shadow's caving in
        It's caving in, caving in
        My lack of shadow is caving in

        I can feel it caving in on me so close
        Do you even feel me here
        Can you tell that it's activating
        Do you even feel me here

        Can you feel my
        Can you feel my
        Can you feel my Disassociation

        Do you even feel me here</p>

    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>Show your teeth, show your teeth
        They can all look but they won't see
        You're the only one who knows where to find me

        Even when I feel the night going slow, you find a way to get your words to me
        And I just try to block it all out cause let it go's all that you say to me
        So can you say something stronger now, say what I need?
        Could you say that you're sorry now, in the tongue that you keep speaking

        But you could find a halo
        And it wouldn't change a thing
        What the hell do you know?
        Let it go is all that you say to me

        Show your teeth, show your teeth
        They can all look but they won't see
        You're the only one who knows where to find me
        So just find me alone instead
        Count all the days I spend
        Breaking the bones I bend
        The feeling is real but the smile, the smile is fake

        Now your empathy seems reserved for someone else
        And though it hurts to say, I miss the way you made me see myself
        But I've watched your gaze decay away into an empty stare
        And even though you understand me still, it doesn't mean you care

        And you could find a halo
        And it wouldn't change a thing
        What the hell do you know?
        Let it go is all that you say to me

        Show your teeth, show your teeth
        They can all look but they won't see
        You're the only one who knows where to find me
        So just find me alone instead
        Count all the days I spend
        Breaking the bones I bend
        The feeling is real but the smile, the smile is fake

        The smile is faker, the future is bleaker, I'm running out of things to hold onto
        Your face in the moment is all that I see and, I hate the way I feel when I'm with you
        Cause the world keeps spinning and you keep singing that I should just cover up
        And I'm sick of it

        Show your teeth, show your teeth
        They can all look but they won't see
        You're the only one who knows where to find me
        So just find me alone instead
        Count all the days I spend
        Breaking the bones I bend
        The feeling is real but the smile, the smile is fake

        Find me alone instead
        Count all the days I spend
        Breaking the bones I bend

    <h1>alone (out of my head) </h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>You sat in the doorway and I couldn't see straight, I rubbed my eyes to see you
        I told you to run, you took a look at the sun, looked me right in the face and I knew
        I think you really meant it then, I feel like there was weight up on the words you said
        But I don't think you mean it now, I hear your voice all the time and it's a different sound

        I can't do this alone, cut me to the bone, gotta get you outta my head
        I can't do this alone, cut me to the bone, gotta get you outta my
        Gotta get you outta my head, my head
        My head, my head
        (Gotta get you outta my head)

        I gotta get you outta my system, you played the victim
        But we did everything so wrong together, everything so wrong
        And I just want you to know that, I can't even function, I can't even focus in
        I just want you to know that I can't even listen, your words are crippling

        Gotta get you outta my head, my head
        My head, my head
        (Gotta get you outta my head)

        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, I gotta get you outta my...

        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head
        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head

        I can't do this alone
        I can't do this alone

        I can't do this alone, cut me to the bone, gotta get you outta my
        Gotta get you outta my head, my head
        My head, my head
        (Gotta get you outta my head)

        Get you outta my, can't get you outta my head

    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>So why'd you follow? Even if it meant
        We would only be sleeping when we're dead
        Took a road that we couldn't return from
        And I found sorrow at the edge of your bed

        She can't be lonely as she says she is
        And I can't do anything to change how it is
        I'll probably take down all the pictures, if to you it's all the same
        So why'd you have to run, why'd you have to go and keep calling out my name
        Calling out my name

        So why'd you follow? Even if it meant
        We would only be sleeping when we're dead
        Took a road that we couldn't return from
        And I found sorrow at the edge of your bed
        Follow even if it meant
        We would only be sleeping when we're dead
        Took a road that we couldn't return from
        And I found sorrow at the edge of your bed

        I found sorrow here
        I found sorrow here
        I found sorrow here
        I found sorrow at the edge of your bed

        Is it now a bad habit?
        Where I can only feel peace when the wave hits
        And I've become what I thought was wrong
        I love the feeling when it feels too strong

        Is it now a bad habit?
        Where I can only feel peace when the wave hits
        And I've become what I thought was wrong
        I love the feeling when it feels too strong

        Is it now a bad habit?
        Where I can only feel peace when the wave hits
        I've become what I thought was wrong

        You changed your mind
        No time to get a little louder like

        Lately there's been a lot to run away from
        It's taking time now to bury all the pain from you
        And I just can't see
        How to get home from the way that you took me through
        I've been caught in a spiral
        Counting the people I'm losing in my world
        I never thought I'd be just a tack on the wall
        I never thought we'd go from a run to a crawl

        No hope, no sign
        You changed your mind
        No hope, no sign

        So why'd you have to go and just vanish away from me?
        Now I see you in my sleep
        I feel shadows and figures, and I hear the whispers
        But now I see you in my sleep

        I feel shadows and figures
        And I swear I hear the whispers
        But what's it gonna take for you
        What's it gonna take just to get a little closer now
        Just to get a little closer now

        No hope, no sign
        Fading I feel it by the hour
        You changed your mind

        So why'd you have to go and just vanish away from me?
        Now I see you in my sleep
        I feel shadows and figures, and I hear the whispers

        Leave us, leave us
        In the past took our love and you put it in the noose
        So why should I forgive you?
        You're the reason I choose
        Feelings, feelings
        Feelings over everybody else I knew

        Now you won't come home, and you won't get close
        And you pay me no mind now, until you're feeling all cold
        And now you got a lot to lose
        With the same old people in the same old room
        And now you got a lot to prove

        Tell me I'm wrong now, tell me you're gone now
        Sing me a song that we used to sing
        Follow along now, follow along now
        I hate the way you feel so differently
        And it's been so long
        No love for a place you showed me
        The scent of the ocean stained my skin
        Time moves on but the wound heals slowly

        So would you tell me I'm wrong
        Can't stop thinking that I'm not worth saving
        Here on my own
        Why do I still feel so lost between
        Who I am and who you wanted me to be?

        I've gotta know, does your heart still scream my name
        I've gotta know, did the cold freeze up your mind and wash me away
        Wash me away
        Time moves on but the wound heals slowly

        And I can still feel the pressure
        Weighing down on my chest oh no
        It's not getting any better
        No it's not oh

        So would you tell me I'm wrong
        Can't stop thinking that I'm not worth saving
        Here on my own
        Why do I still feel so lost between
        Who I am and who you wanted me to be?

        I remember
        Everything a little bit brighter than this
        And I remember
        The feeling of your touch on my wrist</p>

    <h1>The Other Side Of Things</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>I look up the street and I see your house now
        I see the sun but the cold begins
        I can't bear to feel it anymore
        I had to go and leave, follow pain within

        Everything went and changed the day you left
        Now I sit awake dying here instead

        I see your mother, your sister, your father
        I hope they understand you
        I see your mother, your sister, your father
        And my heart breaks to that view

        Cause now you know, now you know
        Everything to feel on the other side of things
        Now you know, now you know
        Everything it took to break inside of me

        Now I know, now I know
        I hope you don't, I hope you don't
        Hate me for following a path of substance
        And self abuse so I can keep on running
        So I can go and chase a darker truth
        So I appreciate all of the brighter views
        So I can feel the things that went and ruined you
        So I can realize what it takes to choose

        I can't even hear your voice inside my head
        Can't even think of all the funny shit you said

        Now you're sleeping
        Now you're dreaming
        Now you let go
        Now you echo

        I see your mother, your sister, your father
        I hope they understand you
        I see your mother, your sister, your father
        And my heart breaks to that view

        Cause now you know, now you know
        Everything to feel on the other side of things
        Now you know, now you know
        Everything it took to break inside of me

        Now you know, now you know
        Everything to feel on the other side of things
        Now you know, now you know
        Now I'm losing you</p>

    <h1>Gone In Your Wake </h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>Maybe I felt a little too much for you cause I came crashing down
        Maybe I broke, maybe I should go to you, but you won't see me
        Maybe I was just a stepping stone for you to walk across
        Maybe I was meant, maybe I was meant to lose you all along

        But I just never got a chance to show
        You the man that I've become today
        And I just hope you took the time to know
        I was lost for years, I'm gone in your wake
        I'm gone, I'm gone in your wake

        I'm sorry I tried to let you close up the void you saw in me
        But I don't think I'll ever re-find the love we shared. You ruined me
        Maybe I was just a stepping stone for you to walk across
        Maybe I was meant, maybe I was meant to lose you all along

        But I just never got a chance to show
        You the man that I've become today
        And I just hope you took the time to know
        I was lost for years, I'm gone in your wake
